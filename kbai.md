## 1:03 Conundrums

1. Intelligrent agents have limited computational resources (memory, computational speed), but most interesting AI problems are computationally intractable. How, then, do we get AI agents to give us real-time/near real-time performance on interesting problems?

2. All competition is local, but most AI problems have global constraints. How can we get AI agents to addrss global problems using local computation?

3. Logic is deductive, but many problems are not — they're inductive or abductive (??). How do we get AI agents (AIA) to address these?

4. The world is dynamic and knowledge is limited. An AIA always begins with what it already knows. So how can an AIA address a novel problem?

5. Problem solving, reasoning, and learning are hard. But explanation and justification are even harder — so how do we get AIAs to explain and justify their decisions?

## Characteristics of AI problems

1. knowledge/data often arrives incrementally
2. problems exhibit recurring patterns
3. problems have multiple levels of granularity/abstraction
4. Many problems are computationally intractable. 
5. The world is dynamic, but *knowledge* of the world is static
6. The world is open-ended, but *knowledge* of it is limited.

How do we design AIAs that address AI problems with these characteristics?

## AIA characteristics

1. AIAs have limited computing power
2. AIAs have limited sensors (can't detect everything)
3. AIAs have limitefd attention
4. Computational logic is fundamentally deductive
5. AIA's knowledge is incomplete relative to the world

How can AIAs that are so limited address open-ended problems?

## Jeopardy quiz

Watson must:

1. Understand text
2. Search through knowledge base
3. decide on answer
4. phrase answer in form of a question

## What is Knowlege-based AI?
1. Reasoning
2. Learning (Watson is learning that an answer is right/wrong )
3. Memory (Watson stores this, using it in later reasoning processes)

All these are interconnected, and are called *deliberation*.

We have input in the form of perceptions of the world, and output in the form of actions on the world. The agent architecture also includes *metacognition* and *reaction*.

## Foundations: The four schools of AI

On one end of the spectrum is acting. On the other is thinking.
